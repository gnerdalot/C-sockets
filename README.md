C socket studies code

Notes

* sudo tcpdump port 9001    will snoop traffic coming in before it hits iptables.
traffic comes back on a different ephemeral port e.g.out 9001, back on 32000 or so.
The code works - iptables was the issue.

This code is less "innovation" and really "Learn how to build wheels by reinventing one."

runcmd - run a command

spliti - split lines on index(length)

unpudp-cmd-v2 - re-implement rsh
